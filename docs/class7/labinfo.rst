Lab Network Setup
-----------------

In the interest of focusing as much time as possible configuring your
application delivery controller, we have provided some resources and
basic setup ahead of time. These are:

-  Cloud-based lab environment complete with a Windows 10 Jumphost, two 
   virtual BIG-IP's (VE), and an Ubuntu Server running a LAMP Stack.

-  The virtual BIG-IPs have been pre-licensed

To access the lab environment, you will need a web browser and
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client software. If you are using a MAC you will
need to download the Microsoft RDP client from the Apple Mac App Store.  The web
browser will be used to access the lab training portal. The RDP client will be used to 
connect to a Windows 10 Jumphost where you will access the virtual BIG-IP (VE)
via the Google Chrome browser and perform testing of configuration resources 
configured throughout each lab.

You class instructor will provide additional lab access details.

Timing for Labs

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time it takes to perform each lab varies and is mostly dependent on
accurately completing steps. This can never be accurately predicted but
we strived to derive an estimate among several people each having a
different level of experience. Below is an estimate of how long it will
take for each lab:

+------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB Name (Description)                               | Time Allocated   |
+======================================================+==================+
| LAB 1 – Configure Virtual Servers and Pools          | 35 minutes       |
+------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 2 – Work with SNAT, Profiles, and Monitors       | 45 minutes       |
+------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 3 – Use SSL Offload, Best Practices, and iApps   | 40 minutes       |
+------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 4 – Configure High Availability                  | 30 minutes       |
+------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
