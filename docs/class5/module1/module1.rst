Module 1 â€“ Resilient Data Center Architectures
==============================================

In this module you will learn how to configure BGP on the BIG-IP and understand how High Availability configurations work with ZebOS and external network devices.

On the West Data Center you will configure a standard HA Active/Standby Pair of BIG-IP devices and peer with your CPE devices connecting to the Internet. It is designed to help you understand how ZebOS interacts with the BIG-IP and any BGP peers.

On the East Data Center you will configure two redundant BIG-IP devices using BGP as the failover mechanism itself. You will also configure and test controlling failover between the two data centers.

Lastly in Lab 3 you will go through some basic troubleshooting steps.
