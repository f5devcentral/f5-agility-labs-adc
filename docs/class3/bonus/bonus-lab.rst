Bonus Lab – Traffic groups, iApps and Active-Active
===================================================

If you have time, this is a bonus lab. Here you will create a new
traffic group. You will use iApps to create a new HTTP application that
reside in that address group and you will create a floating IP address
that will be used as the default gateway that also resides in that
traffic group.

Building a new traffic group and floating IP.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. On your **Active** BIG-IP, go to **Device Management >> Traffic Groups** and hit **Create**

   #. Use the f5.http template, which was designed for general web services

      #.  **Name**: iapp_tg
      
      #.  Take the defaults for the rest.

#. Add a floating Self-IP to the **server_vlan**. Go to **Network >> Self IP**

   #. **Name:**  server_gateway
   
   #. **IP Address:**  10.1.20.240
   
   #. **Netmask:**  255.255.255.0
   
   #. **VLAN/Tunnel:**  server_vlan
   
   #. **Traffic Group:**  iapp_tg (floating)

Building an HTTP application using an iApp template.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to **iApp >> Application** **Services** and hit **Create**

   #. Use the f5.http template, which was designed for general web services
   
      #.  Set the **Template Selection** to **Advanced**
      
      #.  **Name**: my_new_iapp
      
      #.  **Traffic Group:** iapp_tg (floating)
      
         #. You will have to uncheck the **Inherit traffic group from current partition / path**.
         
      #.  Under **Template Options**
      
         #. Select the **Advanced – Configure advanced options** for the configuration mode
         
      #. Under the **Network** tab
      
         #. **How have you configured routing on your web servers?** Servers have a route to the clients through the BIG-IP system
         
            #. In other words, the BIG-IP is the default gateway for the servers
            
            #. Otherwise the template would use SNAT by default
            
      #. Under **Virtual Server and Pools**
      
         #. Your virtual server IP is **10.1.10.110**
         
         #. Your hostname will be `www.f5agility.com <http://www.f5agility.com>` because you have to put one in.
         
         #. Create a new pool with the members **10.1.20.14:80** and **10.1.20.15:80**
         
            #. **If you hit add after the last pool member and have a new row, you will need to delete the row prior to finishing**
            
      #. Hit **Finished** at the bottom of the page

#. Go to **iApp >> Application Services** and select the new application you created

   #. Select **Components** from the top bar
   
      #. Here you will see all the configuration items created by the iApp
      
      #. Do you see anything created that you weren’t asked about?

#. Remember the concept of strictness? Let’s test that out

   #. Go to **Local Traffic >> Pools >> Pool List**
   
      #. Select the pool created by your iApp: **my_new_iapp_pool**
      
      #. Attempt to add **10.15.11.13:80** to your **my_new_iapp_pool**
      
         #. Did it fail?
         
   #. Go to your iApp and select **Reconfigure** from the top bar
   
      #. Now attempt to add your new pool member
      
      #. You can check the Components tab to verify your success

**SYNCHRONIZE YOUR CHANGES**

Active-Active Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Now, let’s make our sync-failover group active-active. On the **Active** BIG-IP:

   #. Go to **Device Management >> Traffic Groups**
   
      #. Go to you **iapp_tg** traffic group.
      
      #. Under **Advanced Setup Options**
      
         #. You are going to set up **iapp_tg** to prefer to run on **bigip02.f5agility.com** and auto failback to **bigip02** if **bigip02** should go down and come back up later.
         
         #. Is this normally a good idea?

      #. **Failover Method:** HA Order
      
      #. **Auto Failback:** <checked>
      
      #. **Failover Order:** **bigip102.f5agility.com** then **bigip01.f5agility.com**
      
      #. Ensure you synchronized the change to the other BIG-IP

#. If the traffic group is active on the wrong BIG-IP initially you will have to do a Force to Standby on the traffic group to make it active on the BIG-IP you want it on by default

   #. What is the ONLINE status of each of your BIG-IPs?
   
   #. Reboot the BIG-IP with your second traffic group on it. Watch to see if the application becomes active on the other BIG-IP during the reboot and if it falls back to the Default Device once the BIG-IP has come back up.
   
   #. You can verify this by checking your traffic groups or going to the web server and looking at the client IP
